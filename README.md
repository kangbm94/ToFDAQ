I Believe you can easily extend the number of modules in control, as it is well-wrapped in a class.
Triggering condition can be programed by modifying the function "WaitModules()".
You can set Machine Initialization parameters in "InitModules()"
If you have any issues on this code, please fix it by yourself and let me know.
